# Dockerizing an Application

The following is a brief description of Docker Containers and what they have to offer from the [getting started page](https://www.docker.com/get-started) of the [docker site](https://www.docker.com).

Building and deploying new applications is faster with containers. Docker containers wrap up software and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development that includes everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools and libraries. This guarantees that your application will always run the same and makes collaboration as simple as sharing a container image (see [docker's get started page](https://www.docker.com/get-started)).

Docker containers whether [Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/windows-containers) or Linux are backed by Docker tools and APIs and help you build better software:

- Onboard faster and stop wasting hours trying to set up development environments, spin up new instances and make copies of production code to run locally.
- Enable polyglot development and use any language, stack or tools without worry of application conflicts.
- Eliminate environment inconsistencies and the "works on my machine" problem by packaging the application, configs and dependencies into an isolated container.
- Alleviate concern over application [security](https://www.docker.com/products/security)
